### Project Overview
InTheMacro is a project that I built to solve a problem that I have with regards to tracking my macro-nutrients and staying accountable with my food intake goals. Things that I sought to learn were UI/UX design, integrating APIs (in this case Firebase), and better full stack skills. This app allows you to enter in the macros for the food that you eat and it will store that progress for each day. Tracked data and the use of graphics shows you what your intake looks like so you can better understand how you can achieve your goals.
